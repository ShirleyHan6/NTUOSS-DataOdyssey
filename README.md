### Introduction

Data science is highly regarded as one of the most important skills to learn. But what is data science even about, and how do you utilize it? For the next three weeks, NTU Open Source Society will be hosting 3 workshops designed to introduce the concept from a novice level to how companies use data science in the real world.

The second workshop will introduce two machine learning algorithms in order to demonstrate how the field can be used in real-world scenarios. <br>
This includes logistic regression, a supervised method to solve classification problems, as well as k-means clustering, an unsupervised method to group together clusters of data by certain criteria.

### Google Colabtory
See [NTUOSS-PandasBasics](https://github.com/wilsonteng97/NTUOSS-PandasBasics)for a comprehensive introduction on how to use Google Colabtory for data science projects and let's walk through it.
